            Since the 1960's the United State's intelligence community has
            almost certainly progressed. Prior to Nixon, the intelligence
            community was less of a community and more of a collection of
            competing factions. The competition between agencies led to wasted
            time and rescources as each agency would be working on gathering
            information on the same topics as each other. Aside from that,
            Intelligence agencies did more than just gather inteligence,
            sometimes operating as a pseudo military branch much to the
            detriment of the United States' security interests like with the
            disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion. In more recent years, cooperation
            within the intelligence community has been a key focus of policy
            makers and the focus of the US intelligence community has been on
            gathering information for their respective military branch or
            department. The SCOTUS holds protecting American foreign policy
            interests and national security in very high reguard and as a result
            have ruled in favor of the intelligence community in almost every
            lawsuit brought against them whether it be{" "}
            <i>Nixon v. Administrator of General Services</i> or{" "}
            <i>Federal Bureau of Investigation v. Fazaga.</i> Most recently the
            intelligence community has directed its attention towards the
            ongoing war in Ukraine, becoming a massive headache for Putin by
            calling his moves before he makes them and sharing their
            intelligence with the Ukrainian armed forces. This is however coming
            a few months after one of the greatest failures of the past decade
            in Afganistan so despite a good showing so far in eastern Europe the
            intelligence community is still far from perfect. Looking forward it
            is likely that they will continue to focus their efforts on
            supporting the Ukrainian armed forces and the Ukranian resistance
            should the government fall.
